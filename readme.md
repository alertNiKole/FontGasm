## Description: 

Font Pairing utility for Developers
This app will take fonts from Google Fonts and pair them based on user selection and display them in the appropriate box and alter the appropriate text on screen.

The Dev will then also be able to grab the font pairings code for use in their project.

This will couple well with Google Fonts in that it allows them to use the fonts by choice instead of only being able to see the recommended fonts on the site. You can choose up to 3 font pairings and place them into various element blocks. 

## Tools:

Mongo or JSON
Express
Grid
Node
